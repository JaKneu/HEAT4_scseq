Abstract
Background:
Activation of the immune system contributes to cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The role of human-specific long noncoding RNAs in cardioimmunology is poorly understood.
Methods:
Single cell sequencing in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) revealed a novel human-specific long noncoding RNA called heart-failure associated transcript 4 (HEAT4). HEAT4 expression was assessed in several in vitro and ex vivo models of immune cell activation, as well as in the blood of patients with heart failure (HF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and cardiogenic shock (CS). The transcriptional regulation of HEAT4 was verified through cytokine treatment and single cell sequencing. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies and multiple RNA–protein interaction assays uncovered a mechanistic role of HEAT4 in the monocyte anti-inflammatory gene program. HEAT4 expression and function was characterized in a vascular injury model in NOD.CB-17-Prkdc scid/Rj mice.
Results:
HEAT4 expression is increased in the blood of patients with HF, AMI and CS. HEAT4 levels distinguish patients with HF from non-HF individuals and predict all-cause mortality in a cohort of HF patients over 7 years of follow-up. Monocytes, particularly anti-inflammatory CD16+ monocytes that are increased in HF patients, are the primary source of HEAT4 expression in the blood. HEAT4 is transcriptionally activated by treatment with anti-inflammatory IL-10. HEAT4 activates anti-inflammatory and inhibits pro-inflammatory gene expression. Increased HEAT4 levels result in a shift towards more CD16+ monocytes. HEAT4 binds to S100A9 causing a monocyte subtype switch, thereby reducing inflammation. As a result, HEAT4 improves endothelial barrier integrity during inflammation and promotes vascular healing after injury in mice.
Conclusion:
These results characterize a novel endogenous anti-inflammatory pathway that involves the conversion of monocyte subtypes into anti-inflammatory CD16+ monocytes. The data identify a novel function for the class of long noncoding RNAs by preventing protein secretion and suggest long noncoding RNAs as potential targets for interventions in the field of cardioimmunology.
